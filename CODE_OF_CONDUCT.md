# Really don't care Code of Conduct

## My Pledge

To collect the bugs and their solutions and other quirks I've encountered. Mainly for myself and other wandering souls those battling against IT swamp.

## My Standards

* Using straight to the point language, however...
* ... I do not care how badly the words are used until the professional content remains understandable
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism
* Showing empathy towards other suffering IT guys
* I reserve the right to decide what is appropriate for this site and what does not

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.. wait a minute... i'll never add commenting section to anywhere at my page :) LOL'
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
 
## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be
ignored and try to move along. If/when trolls deployed at our borders, gates will be
closed and... you know, when shitstorm is coming: brandish your umbrellas

Project contributors  who do not follow the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions.

However it has gutted a little.
